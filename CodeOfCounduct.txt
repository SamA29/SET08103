Code of conduct.

Meetings
We will be holding 1-2 meetings a week. One for organisation; sharing what we have
done and what we need to do for the following week. The other meeting will be a
quick call to catch up and see if anyone has any major problems.
Do not miss any meetings, if you foresee you won't join, say it in the group chat and
we will re-schedule.

Tasks
We have Code submissions every 3 weeks (x3) and the last one is 5 weeks after the
previous submission.
Tasks will be shared fairly amongst the members of the group. If you wish to work on
a specific task or if you think you won't be able to do a task due to difficulty, speak up
and discuss it with the group.
Progress must be seen on the tasks in weekly meetings.
What if I don't know what to do?
Ask. If you're not sure what tasks you're supposed to do, or if you are having trouble
with one of your tasks, ask in the group chat.
● If working on a task and unsure of how to proceed, ask the team for more
perspective
Other
● Do not share information from our project with others (eg. friends in a different
group) to avoid plagiarism.
● Be active and responsive in the group chat if your feedback is needed.
● Sharing thoughts. Negative or positive, it is encouraged to share with your
teammates know how you feel about tasks or maybe their behaviour so we
can make changes if necessary and work in a friendly environment.

Minor and major penalties will apply for violation of the Code of Conduct
